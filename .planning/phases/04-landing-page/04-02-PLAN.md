<objective>
Build the landing page sections: Hero, How It Works, Features, Pricing, Open Source, FAQ, and Footer. Each section is a standalone Svelte component composed in the landing page.

Purpose: The landing page is the primary conversion funnel. Visitors need to understand what Rachel Cloud is, how it works, what it costs, and how to sign up -- all within a single scroll.

Output: Complete landing page with all sections, responsive design, working CTAs to /signup, GitHub star widget, expandable FAQ.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Hero, HowItWorks, and Features sections</name>
  <files>
    src/lib/components/landing/Hero.svelte
    src/lib/components/landing/HowItWorks.svelte
    src/lib/components/landing/Features.svelte
  </files>
  <action>
    Create directory `src/lib/components/landing/` if it doesn't exist.

    **Hero.svelte:**
    - Full-width section with centered content
    - Bold headline communicating the core value: personal AI assistant on Telegram, managed hosting
    - Subheadline: one sentence explaining what Rachel Cloud does (e.g., "Get your own AI assistant powered by Claude, running 24/7 on Telegram. Zero setup, fully managed.")
    - Primary CTA button: "Sign Up" linking to `/signup` -- prominent, blue-600 background (consistent with existing buttons in login/onboarding)
    - Price shown near CTA: "$20/month" text
    - Responsive: centered layout, text scales down on mobile
    - Use `<section>` with proper semantic HTML, `<h1>` for headline (only h1 on the page)
    - No hero image for now -- the Telegram demo mockup (Plan 04) will be added later as a visual element

    **HowItWorks.svelte:**
    - Section with heading "How It Works"
    - 3 steps in a horizontal row (desktop) / vertical stack (mobile):
      1. Sign Up -- "Create your account and subscribe"
      2. Connect Telegram -- "Create a bot via BotFather and enter your token"
      3. Start Chatting -- "Your AI assistant is live in under 2 minutes"
    - Each step: number/icon, title, brief description
    - Use Tailwind grid: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3`
    - Use `<section>` with `<h2>` heading

    **Features.svelte:**
    - Section with heading "Features" or "Why Rachel Cloud"
    - Grid of 4-6 feature cards, each with:
      - Icon (inline SVG or emoji-free text icon)
      - Feature title
      - Brief description
    - Feature ideas from PROJECT.md:
      - "Powered by Claude" -- Your assistant uses Anthropic's Claude, the most capable AI
      - "24/7 on Telegram" -- Always available, responds in seconds
      - "Dedicated Server" -- Your own VPS, not shared infrastructure
      - "Zero Setup" -- From signup to chatting in under 2 minutes
      - "Fully Managed" -- We handle updates, monitoring, and recovery
      - "Bring Your Own Key" -- Uses your Claude subscription, you control spend
    - Responsive: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
    - Use `<section>` with `<h2>` heading
    - Follow the existing design language: white cards with shadow, gray text, blue accents

    All components use Svelte 5 syntax ($props() if accepting props, $state() for local state). Keep components pure/presentational -- no data fetching, no side effects.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - All three files exist in `src/lib/components/landing/`
    - Each component renders valid HTML with proper semantic elements (section, h1/h2)
    - Hero has an `<a href="/signup">` CTA button
    - Hero includes "$20" price text
    - HowItWorks shows 3 steps
    - Features shows feature cards in a responsive grid
    - No Svelte 4 syntax (no `export let`, no `on:click` directives, no `<slot>`)
  </verify>
  <done>
    Hero section renders with headline, subheadline, CTA to /signup, and price. HowItWorks shows 3-step process. Features shows responsive grid of feature cards. All components use Svelte 5 syntax and Tailwind classes.

    src/routes/(landing)/+page.svelte
  </files>
  <action>
    **Pricing.svelte:**
    - Section with heading "Pricing" or "Simple Pricing"
    - Single pricing card (NOT a comparison table -- there's only one plan):
      - Plan name: "Rachel Cloud"
      - Price: "$20/month" prominently displayed
      - Feature checklist (reuse items from onboarding page):
        - Your own Telegram bot connected to Claude
        - Dedicated VPS instance
        - Fully managed and monitored
        - Auto-updates included
        - Cancel anytime
      - CTA button: "Get Started" or "Sign Up" linking to `/signup`
      - "Cancel anytime" reassurance text below button
    - Card style: match the gradient card style from onboarding page (`bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-indigo-50`, `border-2 border-blue-200`)
    - Use `<section>` with `<h2>` heading

    **OpenSource.svelte:**
    - Dark section (bg-gray-900 text-white) for visual contrast
    - Heading: "Open Source"
    - Brief explanation: Rachel8 is open source, self-host or let us manage it
    - GitHub star button loaded via `github-buttons` script tag:
      - In `onMount`, dynamically create and append `<script src="https://buttons.github.io/buttons.js" async defer>` to document body
      - Render: `<a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/polly3223/Rachel8" data-icon="octicon-star" data-size="large" data-show-count="true" aria-label="Star polly3223/Rachel8 on GitHub">Star</a>`
    - "View on GitHub" link button (white/outline style)
    - Use `<section>` with `<h2>` heading

    **FAQ.svelte:**
    - Section with heading "Frequently Asked Questions"
    - 5-7 FAQ items, each with question and expandable answer
    - Use Svelte 5 `$state()` for tracking which FAQ item is open (toggle on click)
    - Example questions:
      - "What do I need to get started?" -> A Claude subscription (Max or Team plan) and a Telegram account.
      - "Do I need my own Claude API key?" -> No. You connect your existing Claude account via OAuth. No API key needed.
      - "What happens if my instance goes down?" -> We monitor all instances 24/7 and auto-restart them.
      - "Can I cancel anytime?" -> Yes. Cancel anytime with a 3-day grace period.
      - "Is Rachel open source?" -> Yes! Rachel8 is fully open source. Self-host or let us manage it.
      - "What can Rachel do?" -> Anything Claude can do: answer questions, write code, summarize content, manage reminders, and more -- all via Telegram.
    - Accessible: use `<button>` for toggling, `aria-expanded` attribute
    - Use `<section>` with `<h2>` heading

    **Footer.svelte:**
    - Simple footer with:
      - Rachel Cloud branding
      - Links: Sign Up, Login, GitHub
      - Copyright notice with current year
    - Minimal styling: `bg-gray-100 border-t`
    - Use `<footer>` semantic element

    **Compose landing page (+page.svelte):**
    - Update `src/routes/(landing)/+page.svelte` to import and render all sections in order:
      ```svelte
      <script lang="ts">
        import Hero from '$lib/components/landing/Hero.svelte';
        import HowItWorks from '$lib/components/landing/HowItWorks.svelte';
        import Features from '$lib/components/landing/Features.svelte';
        import Pricing from '$lib/components/landing/Pricing.svelte';
        import OpenSource from '$lib/components/landing/OpenSource.svelte';
        import FAQ from '$lib/components/landing/FAQ.svelte';
        import Footer from '$lib/components/landing/Footer.svelte';
      </script>

      <main>
        <Hero />
        <HowItWorks />
        <Features />
        <Pricing />
        <OpenSource />
        <FAQ />
      </main>
      <Footer />
      ```
    - Do NOT add meta tags here yet -- that's Plan 03.
    - The TelegramDemo component will be added by Plan 04.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - All four section components exist in `src/lib/components/landing/`

    - FAQ items expand/collapse on click
    - Footer has links to /signup, /login, and GitHub
    - `src/routes/(landing)/+page.svelte` imports and renders all sections

    - Page is responsive: test at 375px, 768px, and 1280px widths
  </verify>
  <done>
    Complete landing page with all 7 sections (Hero, HowItWorks, Features, Pricing, OpenSource, FAQ, Footer) renders at `/`. CTAs link to /signup. GitHub star widget loads. FAQ is interactive. Page is fully responsive.
