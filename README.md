# Rachel Cloud

Managed hosting for [Rachel](https://github.com/polly3223/rachel) — your personal AI assistant on Telegram, deployed and running in minutes.

## What is Rachel?

Rachel is an AI assistant that lives on a server and works for you 24/7 via Telegram. She can:

- Build landing pages and track who fills in your forms
- Send you lead data as Excel, CSV, or any format you want
- Manage contacts, follow-ups, and reminders
- Create documents, proposals, and presentations on demand
- Research suppliers, competitors, or anything you need
- Schedule tasks, set reminders, and handle your admin work
- Translate messages, draft emails, write social media posts

She's not a chatbot. She's a full AI agent — like hiring a personal assistant that never sleeps, for a fraction of the cost.

## Why Rachel?

**Like hiring a full-time assistant for €40/mo.** Rachel builds landing pages, tracks your leads, manages contacts, creates documents, schedules reminders, does research — all from a simple Telegram message. No apps to learn, no dashboards to navigate.

**Works with your existing Claude subscription.** Rachel is powered by Claude, one of the most advanced AI models in the world. If you already have a Claude subscription, you're good to go — no extra AI costs, no gray areas.

**Your own private server.** Each Rachel gets her own dedicated machine with 2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM, 40GB NVMe, and 20TB of traffic. Your data stays on your server — we never see your conversations or business data.

## What is Rachel Cloud?

Rachel Cloud is the managed version. We handle the infrastructure so you don't have to.

You get your own dedicated server with Rachel running on it. Your data, your agent, your server — we just make it easy.

### How it works

1. Sign up and connect your Telegram
2. Connect your Claude subscription (simple login, no API keys)
3. Your personal Rachel is live in ~90 seconds
4. Start chatting on Telegram — she's ready to work

### What's included

- **Dedicated server** — your own isolated machine, not shared with anyone
- **Always on** — 24/7 uptime with automatic health monitoring and recovery
- **Persistent memory** — Rachel remembers everything across conversations
- **Auto-updates** — always running the latest version of Rachel
- **Daily backups** — your memory and files backed up automatically

### Pricing

**€40/month.** That's it. Pays for itself in the first week.

You bring your own Claude subscription. We handle everything else.

**Referral program:** Share Rachel with a friend — you both get €10 off.

## Open Source

Rachel herself is fully open source at [polly3223/rachel](https://github.com/polly3223/rachel). You can self-host her for free if you want to manage your own server.
