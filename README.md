# Rachel Cloud

Managed hosting for [Rachel](https://github.com/polly3223/Rachel8) — your personal AI assistant, deployed and running in minutes.

## What is Rachel?

Rachel is an open-source AI agent that lives on a server and works for you 24/7. Talk to her on Telegram and she can:

- Run commands, write code, manage files on her own server
- Browse the web, do research, fetch and analyze any URL
- Remember everything — persistent memory across conversations
- Schedule tasks autonomously (reminders, cron jobs, background work)
- Read any file you send: PDFs, images, audio, video
- Manage git repos, deploy projects, run scripts

She's not a chatbot. She's a full agent with tools — like having a junior dev / personal assistant that never sleeps.

## What is Rachel Cloud?

Rachel Cloud is the managed version. We handle the infrastructure so you don't have to.

You get your own dedicated server with Rachel running on it. Your data, your agent, your server — we just make it easy.

### How it works

1. Sign up and connect your Telegram
2. Enter your Anthropic API key (you control your own AI spend)
3. Your personal Rachel is live in ~90 seconds
4. Start chatting on Telegram — she's ready to work

### What's included

- **Dedicated server** — your own isolated machine, not shared with anyone
- **Always on** — 24/7 uptime with automatic health monitoring and recovery
- **Persistent memory** — Rachel remembers everything across conversations
- **Auto-updates** — always running the latest version of Rachel
- **Daily backups** — your memory and files backed up automatically
- **Dashboard** — see server status, view logs, manage settings from the web
- **Security** — your API key is encrypted at rest, messages go directly from Telegram to your server to Claude. We never see your conversations.

### Pricing

**$20/month.** That's it.

You bring your own Anthropic API key (for Claude). We handle everything else.

### Why bring your own API key?

- You control your AI costs directly with Anthropic
- No markup on AI usage — pay Anthropic's prices
- We charge only for the platform and infrastructure
- Heavy users and light users pay the same flat rate for hosting

## Open Source

Rachel herself is fully open source at [polly3223/Rachel8](https://github.com/polly3223/Rachel8). You can self-host her for free if you want to manage your own server.

Rachel Cloud exists for people who'd rather just have it work.
