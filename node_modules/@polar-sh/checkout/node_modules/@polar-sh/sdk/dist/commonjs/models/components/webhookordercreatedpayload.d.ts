 * Sent when a new order is created.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * A new order is created when:
 *
 * * A customer purchases a one-time product. In this case, `billing_reason` is set to `purchase`.
 * * A customer starts a subscription. In this case, `billing_reason` is set to `subscription_create`.
 * * A subscription is renewed. In this case, `billing_reason` is set to `subscription_cycle`.
 * * A subscription is upgraded or downgraded with an immediate proration invoice. In this case, `billing_reason` is set to `subscription_update`.
 *
 * > [!WARNING]
 * > The order might not be paid yet, so the `status` field might be `pending`.
